# MyReads Bookshelf Application

This application was created with React, and allows you to categorize books into three different categories: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".  The books are provided by a Udacity API which contains the associated data, including the title, the author(s), and an image.  The application was completed as part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.
